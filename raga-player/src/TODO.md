* Bhajans should specify raga, and just say whether the note is "d" instead of "d1" or "d2"
* Bhajans should also specify note length somehow. Especially gamakas. Maybe reuse the "d/2" syntax to mean for half the bar. "d/4" means 1/4th of the bar.
* So, a bhajan would simply be:
    * p. d. s r g g g r g/2 r/2 s/2 d./2 s\*4
    * s r g p p g r/2 g/4 p/4 g/2 r/2 s/2
* Show the current shruti
* Overall tempo up or down
