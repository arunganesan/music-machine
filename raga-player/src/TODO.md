* Individual song - should have shruti and speed, and buttons to play/pause. buttons for each song: play raga, play song, starting note, highest note, lowest note. plus inputs to set shruti and tempo
* Sample actual harmonium sound:
* Long term: we can add lyrics to each line. It's already typed out. basically each line for a song has lyrics + notes. the current line that's playing will highlight that lyric. "play song" will go through all. if you click on individual lines, it will just play that line in the current tempo + shruti.
* Build and put it on website so we can load it on phone/ipad
